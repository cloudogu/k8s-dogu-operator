                      Increasing this value leads to an automatic volume expansion.
                      This includes a downtime for the respective dogu. The default
                      size for volumes is "2Gi". It is not possible to lower the volume
                      size after an expansion. This will introduce an inconsistent
                      state for the dogu.
